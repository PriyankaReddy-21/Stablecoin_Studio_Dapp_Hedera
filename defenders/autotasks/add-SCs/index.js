/**
 * This Open Zeppelin Defenders Autotask adds contract's Id to a sentinel defined by "SUBSCRIBER_ID"
 * It is meant to be triggered by another Sentinel monitoring the "Deployed((address,address,address,address,address,address))" event of a Factory.
 * The contracts Id added by the autotask correspond to the Stable Coins deployed by the factory.
 * The Sentinel this autotask is adding contracts Id to is supposed to monitor Stable Coin events.
 * 
 * The autotask prerequirements are:
 * 
 *  - A Sentinel linked to the "SUBSCRIBER_ID"
 *  - An autotask Secret named "API_KEY" with an "team api key" that has the right to manage sentinels
 *  - An autotask Secret named "API_SECRET" with the corresponding "API_KEY" secret
