Common errors when working with stable coin studio --



1. Error when creating a new stable coin : 

i. Check your account balance and ensure you have enough HBars (at least 10 to begin with)
ii. Reduce your initial number of tokens and maximum number of tokens (in case of finite token limit)
iii. Make sure not to use special characters / spaces in token name and symbol.

2. Error when loading an existing stable coin :

i. This is usually due to network congestion, try to reload the stable coin. Might take upto 5-6 tries.

3. Error when connecting to metamask or hash pack account : 

i. Make sure you have an active account on Hedera testate / preview net / main net depending upon which network you are working on.

ii. This issue may also be due to network congestion, try to reconnect. Might take upto 5-6 tries.

4. Error when trying to cash-in the token to an account : 

Error -- "This account is not associated with this token"

i. If using hash pack wallet : 
	- Open your wallet and go to the connected account
	- Under the tokens tab, select "Add token" (maybe represented by a + sign)
	- Here add the token id which you are trying to cash-in. (Token id is given in the tab where you have loaded the token for operating on it. It is in 0.0.XXX... format)
	- Once the token ID is added, all the details related to the token will automatically be loaded on the hash pack page.
	- Check all details and confirm adding this token.
	- Now your account is associated with this token and you may proceed with token operations in stable coin studio.

ii. If using Metamask wallet :
	- Open the stable coin-studio project in VS Code.
	- Open the folder "helper_files" and open a new VS Code terminal.
	- First, rename the .env.sample to .env
	- Add the admin account ID & private key under "MY_ACCOUNT_ID" & "MY_PRIVATE_KEY"
	- Add the user account ID & private key under "USER_ACCOUNT_ID" & "USER_PRIVATE_KEY"
	- Here admin is the account that is operating the stable coin studio & user is the account that wants to cash-in the tokens. If both are same, just add admin details and skip user details.
	- Note, it is important to add both admin and user details even if token association is required for user only.
	- Next, open associateToken.js in VS Code.
	- Here two functions are given - one is for associating the admin with the token and second is for associating the user with the token.
	- First add the token ID here : const TokenId = "0.0.XXXXXXX";
	- Comment out the irrelevant function, if association is needed only for one account (either admin or user)
	- If association is needed for both accounts, keep the file as it is.
	- After making required changes, save the file and type this command in the newly opened VS code terminal : node associateToken.js
	- After successful token association, you will receive confirmation on the VS code terminal.
	- Now you can go back to stable coin studio and try to cash-in with the newly associated account.


5. How to transfer tokens using stable coin studio : This feature is not available in stable coin studio as per current Hedera guidelines. To make token transfers, import the token into your wallet  - Hashpack or Metamask, and do the transfers from there. Transfer many fail if the receiving account is not associated with the token. For this, refer point no.4
